# defining
x = 5
y = 10
name = "John"


# Variable Types
x = 5
y = 3.14
name = "John"
is_student = True

# In this example, we define four variables x, y, name, and is_student. The variable x is an integer, y is a float, name is a string, and is_student is a boolean.

# Type Conversion
x = 5
y = "10"
z = x + int(y)
print(z)  # Output: 15
